## ðŸ§  Inspiration

Growing up, one of our team members was inspired by their best friendâ€™s mother, who was hard of hearing and taught ASL. She often spoke about the need for a mainstream, accessible way to learn ASL. Learning sign language can often be challenging and inaccessible. Henlingo addresses this gap with a Duolingo-style app designed to make learning sign language engaging, effective, and inclusive.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Game-like lessons for an enjoyable learning experience.
- **AI-Powered Feedback**: Real-time analysis to improve signing skills.
- **Progress Tracking**: Personalized tracking to motivate learners on their journey.

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack
- Frontend: TypeScript, NextJS, TailwindCSS, Shadcn
- AI/ML: TensorFlow
- Design: Figma
